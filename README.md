## Why DSH?

- **See what changed.** Review tool edits in VS Code's native side-by-side diff, even outside a Git repository.
- **Decide before execution.** Approval cards show commands and target files, with proposed diffs for supported file writes.
- **Start with context.** Bring files, selections, Git diffs, or paused debugger state into a task without copying everything by hand.
- **Pick up where you left off.** Resume persistent sessions and follow tools, subagents, Todos, and token usage in the Activity panel.

## Quick start

Requires **VS Code 1.106.0 or later** and a configured DSH model provider with credentials.

1. **Install the extension** from the Marketplace or Open VSX links above, or search for `harcochen.dsh-vsc-integration` in Extensions.
2. **Open chat.** Open and trust your project folder, then run `DSH: Open Chat` from the Command Palette. The extension automatically starts or connects to a Runtime; by default, it attempts a managed Runtime download when no usable environment is available.
3. **Set up your provider.** Run `DSH: Configure API Key` for DeepSeek credentials. For other providers, use `DSH: Open dsh Web UI in Browser`. Select or register a DSH Workspace, then choose a model.
4. **Give it a task.** Type `@` to reference a file, or right-click a selection for DSH actions. Follow the task, respond to approval requests, and open diffs from tool cards to review the result.

> A **DSH Workspace** groups sessions in Harness and can be associated with a project path. When using the same Runtime, you can continue sessions created in the Web UI.

### Try it on real work

| Your task | A place to start |
| --- | --- |
| Understand unfamiliar code | Select code and use the DSH explain action: “Walk through the execution flow and edge cases.” |
| Review a change | Use the DSH review action on a Git diff in Source Control: “Check these changes for regressions and point to the relevant lines.” |
| Investigate a breakpoint | While paused, run `DSH: Explain Current Debug State` to attach context including the call stack and local variables. |
| Continue earlier work | Switch to a previous session and use the conversation outline to revisit the discussion. |

## Features

### Native diff for every edit, no Git required

After a `write`/`edit` tool call, open the target file to see VS Code's native side-by-side diff. The before-image is reconstructed by replaying hunks backwards from the Session log, so it also works in non-Git repositories and Git-ignored files.

### Preview before approval

The approval card shows the actual command line, working directory, and target files that will be written. For supported file-writing tools, open a native diff of the proposed change before approving it.

### Slash commands enumerated live from the Runtime

The slash menu dynamically fetches commands registered by the Runtime for the current session (`/plan`, `/compact`, `/goal`, etc.) and merges them with the extension's own IDE commands.

### Editor and Git context

- Right-click the current file, selection, or Git diff to explain, fix, review, or generate documentation.
- Right-click `Ask about resource` in Explorer to ask about a file or folder.
- The `@` menu autocompletes project files and previous Sessions.
- `DSH: Capture AppShot` (macOS only) captures a window screenshot and inserts it into the conversation as a draft.

### Sessions, Trace, and Activity at a glance

The sidebar provides a native conversation-outline TreeView. Trace, token usage, Todo lists, and subagents are gathered in the Activity panel. The UI supports VS Code's dark and light themes.

### Credentials and balance

The bottom bar shows your current balance, including peak and off-peak pricing. Low balances are highlighted clearly.

## FAQ

**Do I need to install DSH manually?** Usually no. The extension looks for a usable local environment and attempts to download a managed Runtime when needed. The first download requires network access; `dsh.installWhenMissing` controls automatic installation.

**Can I connect to an existing Runtime?** Yes. Set `dsh.serverUrl` to your running `dsh web` address. The default managed version is `0.1.1-rc.2`; check compatibility before connecting another version, as upstream RPC changes can affect extension features.

**What if startup fails?** Run `DSH: Diagnose Environment`, then `DSH: Show dsh Runtime Logs` from the Command Palette. Include your extension version, OS, and redacted error details when opening an [issue](https://github.com/HarcoChen/deepseek-harness-vscode/issues).

**Does it support Chinese?** Yes. Commands, chat, Activity, and Trace follow VS Code's display language, with English and Simplified Chinese available.

## Architecture and runtime

Multiple VS Code windows preferentially reuse the same local Harness Runtime. The Runtime launched by the extension publishes a random loopback port through a process lock; later windows connect directly, avoiding competing writes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[VS Code Extension Host] <-->|RPC via Loopback Port| B[Standalone Harness Runtime]
    A <-->|Typed Full-State Bridge| C[React Webview UI]
    B <-->|CNB Distribution| D[Managed Local Engine]
    A <-->|Process Lock| E[Multi-Window Shared Runtime]
```

## Configuration

Search `dsh` in VS Code settings for the full list.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dsh.serverUrl` | `""` | URL of an already running dsh web Runtime; when set, the extension connects directly. |
| `dsh.autoStart` | `true` | Automatically start or connect to dsh web when the extension activates. |
| `dsh.installWhenMissing` | `true` | Automatically download and manage a standalone Runtime when no usable npm/dsh environment is available. |
| `dsh.runtimeVersion` | `0.1.1-rc.2` | Locked version of the managed Runtime. |
| `dsh.npmRegistry` | `https://registry.npmmirror.com` | Registry mirror used as a download fallback. |
| `dsh.npxTimeoutMs` | `120000` | Timeout while waiting for package-manager download and startup. |
| `dsh.maxContextBytes` | `120000` | Maximum UTF-8 bytes of `<ide_context>` included per prompt. |
| `dsh.persistSession` | `true` | Reuse the previous Session ID for the current workspace when possible. |
| `dsh.agentStatusLabels` | *fat-whale messages* | Random text shown during each streaming turn; customizable. |
| `dsh.agentStatusLabel` | `""` | Pins a single fixed status line when set. |
| `dsh.enableEffortKnob` | `true` | Use the runner sprite animation as the reasoning-effort slider button. |

## Other ways to install

**From GitHub Releases** — download the `.vsix` from [Releases](https://github.com/HarcoChen/deepseek-harness-vscode/releases) and run `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`. Pre-release builds are published only to GitHub Releases.

**Build from source**:

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm run package
```

Then install the generated `.vsix` via `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`.

## Extension API

Other VS Code extensions can hook into the API DSH exports.

<details>
<summary><strong>Conversation navigation API</strong> — register custom nodes</summary>

```ts
const registration = api.registerConversationNavigation([
    { seq: 42, label: "Review the PPO implementation", detail: "Training config" },
]);
context.subscriptions.push(registration);
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Agent status label API</strong> — customize streaming status text</summary>

```ts
const dsh = vscode.extensions.getExtension<import("dsh-vsc-integration").DshExtensionApi>(
    "harcochen.dsh-vsc-integration",
);
const api = await dsh?.activate();
context.subscriptions.push(
    api?.registerAgentStatusPresentation({ label: "🐋 Diving" }),
);
```

</details>

## Development and testing

```bash
npm install
npm run check      # TypeScript check (host + webview)
npm test           # Release gate: webview check + compile + test suite
npm run compile    # Build to dist/
npm run package    # Compile + vsce package
npm run release    # Test + version bump + CHANGELOG archive + tag
```

To verify the managed Runtime release logic:

```bash
node scripts/verify-managed-runtime.mjs              # remote contract only
node scripts/verify-managed-runtime.mjs --full       # install and smoke-test
```
